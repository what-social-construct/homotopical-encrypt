# Semantic Ownership

HCRYPT separates mathematical truth, formal obligation, executable computation,
and node policy into distinct ownership layers. This keeps the proof stack
honest: Lean can prove the algebraic and hardness facts without pretending to
certify every runtime line, and runtime policy can remain explicit without being
mistaken for a logical connective.

## Ownership Layers

| Layer | Meaning | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Theorem-owned | Lean proves the statement directly. | `Heyting3` residuation, Hodge/CVP statements, spectral classification lemmas |
| Interface-owned | Lean names the obligation; implementations supply witnesses or evidence. | hidden fibration assumptions, oracle modality, stage admissibility |
| Runtime-owned | Python/Rust computes or verifies concrete data. | Laplacian construction, spectral gaps, Betti numbers, oracle classification |
| Policy-owned | Node behavior after a judgment. | `Boundary` → hold/re-evaluate, slashing, mempool retry |
| Concept-owned | Architecture described but not yet formalized. | future fuzzy/L-fuzzy approximation layer, verified extraction |

## Boundary Is Not Implication

The clearest example is the spectral boundary case.

```text
SpectralJudgment.Boundary → Heyting3.Undetermined
SpectralJudgment.Boundary → ConsensusAction.Hold
```

The first map is a public truth collapse. The second map is node policy. Neither
changes the Heyting implication table. In the verified three-element Heyting
chain, implication is residuated, so:

```text
Undetermined ⇒ Invalid = Invalid
```

That does not mean a boundary block is immediately rejected. Rejection/holding is
owned by `ConsensusAction`, while implication is owned by the Heyting algebra.

## Why This Matters

This distinction prevents category errors during verification:

| Do say | Do not say |
|--------|------------|
| Lean proves the public Heyting collapse is residuated. | Runtime hold/retry is Heyting implication. |
| The oracle classifies raw spectral evidence into protocol judgments. | The oracle exposes the hidden fibration or Laplacian. |
| Boundary is non-final and policy-held. | Boundary is logically valid or logically invalid. |
| Python/Rust are runtime-owned until bridged by parity tests or extraction. | Lean currently verifies the whole implementation end to end. |

This follows the same discipline as semantic-accounting approaches to large
formal catalogs: coverage, executable semantics, extensional semantics, and
runtime ownership should be tracked separately rather than collapsed into one
badge.
